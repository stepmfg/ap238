<p class=pagehead>Working Draft ISO 10303-238 Edition 2</p>

<H1 CLASS="unum"><A NAME="introduction"></A>Introduction</H1>

<P>ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the
computer-interpretable representation of product information and for
the exchange of product data.  The objective is to provide a neutral
mechanism capable of describing products throughout their life cycle.
This mechanism is suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but
also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases, and as
a basis for archiving.</P>

<P>This part of ISO 10303 is a member of the application protocol
series. This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol (AP)
for numerical controlled machining and associated processes, including
the scope and information requirements defined by the ISO 14649 data
model for numerical controllers, augmented with product geometry,
geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, and product data management
information.</P>

<P>ISO 14649 defines a richer model for information transfer between
CAD/CAM systems and computerized numerical control (CNC) machines than
that of the older ISO 6983 &quot;G and M code&quot;
language.  <a href="bibliography.htm#iso6983-1">ISO 6983-1</a>
describes the path of the tool centre point with respect to machine
axes.  ISO 14649 describes machining processes with respect to a part,
including part geometry, manufacturing features, sequencing of
operations, associated process parameters, and tool requirements.</P>

<P>
This part of ISO 10303 specifies the integrated resources necessary to
describe the information requirements identified by ISO 14649 in a
manner consistent with the part shape, feature, geometric dimension
and tolerance information created by design and process-planning
activities and represented
by <a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-203">ISO 10303-203</a>,
<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-214">ISO 10303-214</a>,
<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-224">ISO 10303-224</a>, and
<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-240">ISO 10303-240</a>.
It is advisable that users of this part of ISO 10303 understand the
basic principles and concepts of numerical controlled machining and
associated processes and understand and have access to ISO 14649,
particularly ISO 14649-1, ISO 14649-10, ISO 14649-11, ISO 14649-12,
ISO 14649-111, and ISO 14649-121.  A discussion and data planning
model is given in ISO 14649-1.</P>

<P>This application protocol defines the context, scope, and
information requirements for numerical controlled machining and
associated processes and specifies the integrated resources necessary
to satisfy these requirements.</P>

<P>Application protocols provide the basis for developing
implementations of ISO 10303 and abstract test suites for the
conformance testing of AP implementations.</P>

<P>Clause 1 defines the scope of the application protocol and
summarizes the functionality and data covered by the AP.  Clause 3
lists the words defined in this part of ISO 10303 and gives pointers
to words defined elsewhere.  An application activity model that is the
basis for the definition of the scope is provided in Annex F. The
information requirements of the application are specified in clause 4
using terminology appropriate to the application. A graphical
representation of the information requirements, referred to as the
application reference model, is given in Annex G.</P>

<P>Resource constructs are interpreted to meet the information
requirements. This interpretation produces the application interpreted
model (AIM). This interpretation, given in 5.1, shows the
correspondence between the information requirements and the AIM. The
short listing of the AIM specifies the interface to the integrated
resources and is given in 5.2. Note that the definitions and EXPRESS
provided in the integrated resources for constructs used in the AIM
can include select list items and subtypes which are not imported into
the AIM. The expanded listing given in Annex A contains the complete
EXPRESS for the AIM without annotation. A listing of the EXPRESS
entity names and corresponding short names is given in Annex B.
Information object identifiers for the AIM is given in Annex E.  A
graphical representation of the AIM is given in Annex H. Additional
requirements for specific implementation methods are given in Annex C.
A reference to computer interpretable listings of the AIM and EXPRESS
entity short names is given in Annex I.</P>

<P>This edition incorporates the following technical modifications to
ISO 10303-238:2007:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Changes based on experience accumulated from deployment of the first edition in the period 2007-2016</LI>
</UL>

<p>A detailed description of the changes is provided in Annex K.</p>


<P>Warning:</P>
<P>This part of ISO 10303 provides a specification intended to be
implemented in software. Incompatibilities may result in
machine-to-machine communication in the case of software developed on
the basis of translations of this part of ISO 10303 into languages
other than the official ISO languages. It is accordingly strongly
recommended that any implementations be developed only on the basis of
the texts in the official ISO langauages.</P>
