<P>This is a working draft for the second edition of AP238.  The ARM,
mappings and other content from the first edition has been converted
to a simple, one-level HTML document.  The proposed TC content has not
yet been applied and the mappings in clause 5 are still tables, rather
than mapping specifications (separate clauses).

<p>All figures have been converted to SVG and all clauses have anchors
based on their clause number.

<p>Recipients of this draft are invited to submit, with their
comments, notification of any relevant patent rights of which they are
aware and to provide supporting documentation.

<p>During development of this working draft, the document is being
managed at the following GitHub repository:
