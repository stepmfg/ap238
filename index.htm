<P>This is a working draft for the second edition of AP238. The
baseline technical content has been converted to HTML. Each clause is
in a file and most subclauses have a mnemonic anchor. The mappings are
converted to specifications rather than tables, and application
objects have links to mappings and EXPRESS-G.  All figures are now SVG.

<p>The document includes changes accumulated 2007-2019 from first
edition deployment experience.  These changes were originally
documented in TC184/SC4/WG15N2. Prior to the start of second edition
work, these were circulated as a proposed technical corrigendum (TC).

<p>There is a new <a href="annexK.htm">Annex K</a> change log that describes the changes in detail.

<p>Recipients of this draft are invited to submit, with their
comments, notification of any relevant patent rights of which they are
aware and to provide supporting documentation.

<p>During development of this working draft, the document is being
managed at the following GitHub repository:
