<H1 ID="introduction" CLASS="unum">Introduction</H1>

<P>ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the
computer-interpretable representation of product information and for
the exchange of product data.  The objective is to provide a neutral
mechanism capable of describing products throughout their life cycle.
This mechanism is suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but
also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases, and as
a basis for archiving.</P>

<P>This document is a member of the application protocol
series. This document specifies an application protocol (AP)
for numerical controlled machining and associated processes, including
the scope and information requirements defined by the ISO 14649 data
model for numerical controllers, augmented with product geometry,
geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, and product data management
information.</P>

<P>ISO 14649 defines a richer model for information transfer between
CAD/CAM systems and computerized numerical control (CNC) machines than
that of the older ISO 6983 &quot;G and M code&quot;
language.  <a href="bibliography.htm#iso6983-1">ISO 6983-1</a>
describes the path of the tool centre point with respect to machine
axes.  ISO 14649 describes machining processes with respect to a part,
including part geometry, manufacturing features, sequencing of
operations, associated process parameters, and tool requirements.</P>

<P>
This document specifies the integrated resources necessary to
describe the information requirements identified by ISO 14649 in a
manner consistent with the part shape, feature, geometric dimension
and tolerance information created by design and process-planning
activities and represented
by <a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-203">ISO 10303-203</a>,
<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-214">ISO 10303-214</a>,
<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-224">ISO 10303-224</a>, 
<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-240">ISO 10303-240</a>, and
<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-242">ISO 10303-242</a>.
It is advisable that users of this document understand the
basic principles and concepts of numerical controlled machining and
associated processes and understand and have access to ISO 14649,
particularly ISO 14649-1, ISO 14649-10, ISO 14649-11, ISO 14649-12,
ISO 14649-111, and ISO 14649-121.  A discussion and data planning
model is given in ISO 14649-1.</P>

<P>This application protocol defines the context, scope, and
information requirements for numerical controlled machining and
associated processes and specifies the integrated resources necessary
to satisfy these requirements.</P>

<P>Application protocols provide the basis for developing
implementations of ISO 10303 and abstract test suites for the
conformance testing of AP implementations.</P>

<P><a href="clause1.htm">Clause 1</a> defines the scope of the
application protocol and summarizes the functionality and data covered
by the AP.  <a href="clause3.htm">Clause 3</a> lists the words defined
in this document and gives pointers to words defined
elsewhere.  An application activity model that is the basis for the
definition of the scope is provided in <a href="annexF.htm">Annex
F</a>. The information requirements of the application are specified
in <a href="clause4.htm">clause 4</a> using terminology appropriate to
the application. A graphical representation of the information
requirements, referred to as the application reference model, is given
in <a href="annexG.htm">Annex G</a>.</P>

<P>Resource constructs are interpreted to meet the information
requirements. This interpretation produces the application interpreted
model (AIM). This interpretation, given
in <a href="clause5.htm#mappings">5.1</a>, shows the correspondence
between the information requirements and the AIM. The short listing of
the AIM specifies the interface to the integrated resources and is
given in <a href="clause5.htm#aim-short">5.2</a>. Note that the
definitions and EXPRESS provided in the integrated resources for
constructs used in the AIM can include select list items and subtypes
which are not imported into the AIM. The expanded listing given
in <a href="annexA.htm">Annex A</a> contains the complete EXPRESS for
the AIM without annotation. A listing of the EXPRESS entity names and
corresponding short names is given in <a href="annexB.htm">Annex
B</a>. Information object identifiers for the AIM is given
in <a href="annexE.htm">Annex E</a>.  A graphical representation of
the AIM is given in <a href="annexH.htm">Annex H</a>. Additional
requirements for specific implementation methods are given
in <a href="annexC.htm">Annex C</a>. A reference to computer
interpretable listings of the AIM and EXPRESS entity short names is
given in <a href="annexI.htm">Annex I</a>.</P>

<P>This edition incorporates the following technical modifications to
ISO 10303-238:2007:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Changes based on experience accumulated from deployment of the
first edition in the period 2007-2019;</LI>

<LI>Harmonized local application objects replaced with references to
shared modules for continuous integration with AP242 GD&amp;T,
feature, and other usage;</LI>

<LI>Additive manufacturing process UoF added for machine actions
defined by ISO 14649-17.</LI>
</UL>

<p>A detailed description of the changes is provided
in <a href="annexK.htm">Annex K</a>.</p>


<P>Warning:</P>
<P>This document provides a specification intended to be
implemented in software. Incompatibilities can result in
machine-to-machine communication in the case of software developed on
the basis of translations of this document into languages
other than the official ISO languages. It is accordingly strongly
recommended that any implementations be developed only on the basis of
the texts in the official ISO langauages.</P>
