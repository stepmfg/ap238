Part 238: Application protocol:
Model based integrated manufacturing</H1>

<H1 ID="clause-1" CLASS="clause">1 Scope</H1>

<P>This document specifies the use of the integrated
resources necessary for the scope and information requirements for
manufacturing using numerical controlled machining and associated
processes, including the scope and information requirements defined by
the ISO 14649 data model for computerized numerical controllers.</P>

<P CLASS="note">
<SPAN>NOTE 1</SPAN> The application activity model in Annex F provides
a graphical representation of the processes and information flows that
are the basis for the definition of the scope of this document.</P>

<P CLASS="note">
<SPAN>NOTE 2</SPAN> This document is a member of the &quot;STEP
Manufacturing Suite&quot; of ISO 10303 application protocols, which
cover information associated with the manufacture of a product, such
as the input to process planning
(<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-224">ISO 10303-224</a>), the
output from macro-process planning
(<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-240">ISO 10303-240</a>),
model-based machining (this document), casting
(<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-223">ISO 10303-223</a>) and the
output from dimensional inspection
(<a href="bibliography.htm#iso10303-219">ISO 10303-219</a>).  While
each application protocol has unique scope elements, other elements,
such as manufacturing feature and manufacturing tolerance
descriptions, are common to many of these application protocols.</P>

<P>The following are within the scope of this document:</P>

<UL>
<LI>mechanical parts for manufacturing;</LI>
<LI>manufacturing process descriptions, including manufacturing
operations, sequences of operations, and associated information as
defined in ISO 14649;</LI>
</UL>

<P CLASS="note">
<SPAN>NOTE 3</SPAN> The ISO 14649 documents available at the time of
publication cover milling, drilling, turning, and additive
manufacturing processes (ISO 14649-11, ISO 14649-12, and ISO
14649-17).  Future editions of this document might include additional
processes if additional ISO 14649 descriptions become available.</P>

<UL>
<LI>the AS-IS and TO-BE shapes of a mechanical part;</LI>
<LI>manufacturing features of a part;</LI>
<LI>manufacturing tolerance requirements of a part;</LI>
<LI>tool requirements for machining operations;</LI>
<LI>tool paths for machining operations;</LI>
<LI>manufacture of mechanical products using manufacturing processes defined in ISO 14649;</LI>
<LI>manufacturing product discipline view.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The following are outside the scope of this document:</P>

<UL>
<LI>composite material parts;</LI>
<LI>description of manufacturing activities not related to automatic execution by a computerized numerical controller;</LI>
</UL>

<P CLASS="note">
<SPAN>NOTE 4</SPAN> This includes activities such as factory capacity planning and scheduling.</P>

<UL>
<LI>a catalogue of machines available on a factory floor;</LI>
<LI>a catalogue of tools available in a machine tool magazine;</LI>
<LI>design features of a part;</LI>
<LI>manufacturing preplanning activities;</LI>
<LI>product discipline views other than manufacturing.</LI>
