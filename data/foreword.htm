<P>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a
worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member
bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally
carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body
interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that
committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work.
ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical
standardization.</P>
